      <h3>Here's a timeline of Arsene Wenger's life in Arsenal Football Club</h3>
      <ul id="lifetime">
        <li>Born 22 October 1949 (age 69) in Strasbourg, France.</li>
        <li>A French football manager and former player.</li>
        <li>He obtained a manager's diploma in 1981. Wenger joined AS Monaco; the club won the league championship in 1988. In 1991, Wenger guided Monaco to victory in the Coupe de France, but their failure to regain the league title in later seasons led
          to his departure from the club by mutual consent in 1994.</li>
        <li>In 1996, Wenger became Arsenal manager and two years later the club completed a league and FA Cup double. The club won another league and cup double in 2002 and retained the FA Cup a year later.</li>
        <li>In 2004, Wenger managed Arsenal to an undefeated league season, a feat last accomplished by Preston North End, 115 years previously. Arsenal later eclipsed <span class="club">Nottingham Forest</span>'s record of 42 league matches unbeaten and
          went seven more matches before losing in October 2004. The club made their first appearance in a Champions League final in 2006, though they lost to <span class="club">Barcelona</span>. After a period of nine years without a trophy, which coincided
          with the club relocating to the Emirates Stadium, Wenger guided Arsenal to further FA Cup success in 2014 and 2015. Alongside <span class="club">George Ramsay</span>, he is the most successful manager in the competition's history with six titles.
        </li>
        <li>He is fondly called "Le Professeur" (French for "The Professor") a nickname given to him by fans and the British media to reflect Wenger's studious demeanour. </li>
        <li>Preferred formation: 4-2-3-1</li>
      </ul>
